<h1>Simple database for our little project</h1>
<p>
    Please understand that this is just a really simple stuff
    and may not contain every goddamn function and feature that you may crave.
</p>
<h2>What it does</h2>
<p>
    You can add items to storage (if you have some) so we can all know
    who added what, where, when and how many.
</p>
<h2>What it does not do</h2>
<p>
    There is no login (so far) so please be careful with who you are sharing this link:
    <a href="http://akela.mendelu.cz/~xcizek/ME/">akela.mendelu.cz/~xcizek/ME</a>.
    Othervise we might get some unpleasant spam in our database
    and it would be a real pain to recover what we had before that.

    So long as there is no Authentication, there is no warranty that it has correct data.
